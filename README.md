* [**src**](https://github.com/sukhleen-kaur/CoreIR2020/tree/master/src): contains the code for the baseline model, Best Feature Calibration (BFC), K-Means adaptive clustering on 1-Fold, K-Means and hierarchical adaptive clustering on 5-fold and the code for analysing the results.
* [**results**](https://github.com/sukhleen-kaur/CoreIR2020/tree/master/results): contains the results generated in .csv format.
* [**img**](https://github.com/sukhleen-kaur/CoreIR2020/tree/master/img): contains the plot generated as a result of the analysis.

The following tools were used:
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Pyltr](https://github.com/jma127/pyltr)
